### FLApp ###

* This is the FLApp

It has 3 screens
* AdScreen - list of ads
* AdDetailScreen - a detailed view for the ad
* FilterScreen - shows options to filter the list of ads

The views are created from storyboard, but navigation is handled by Navigator (Inspired by CaptainNavigator).
The service layer is modular and you can easily add new requests.
Images are handled by Kingfisher, cache is handled by Disk

### I could have done better ###
If I had more time, I could have added more unit tests, cleaner navigation and handled all possible errors. 
And added more description!!

Few days of learning about finn through github and finniverskit, I have already learned a lot. Finn team, you did a great work!
Hope to work with the team soon. Thanks guys for this opportunity!
